# How Edabit Works

This is an introduction to how challenges on Edabit work. In the **Code** tab above, you'll see a starter function that looks like this:

```java
public static boolean returnTrue() {

}
```

All you have to do is type between the curly braces and then click the **Check** button. If you did this correctly, the button will turn red and say **SUBMIT FINAL**. Click it and see what happens.

```java
return true;
```

## Notes

- If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in the **Resources** tab.
- If you're really stuck, unlock solutions in the **Solutions** tab.
